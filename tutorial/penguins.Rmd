## Palmer Penguins

```{r, out.width = 500, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Artwork by @allison_horst"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/figures/lter_penguins.png")
```
The [**palmerpenguins** package](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/)
includes data for adult foraging Ad√©lie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo
penguins observed on islands in the Palmer Archipelago near Palmer
Station, Antarctica. Data were collected and made available by
Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station Long Term Ecological
Research (LTER) Program.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins
```


## How Many Are There?

The variables `species` and `island` are categorical.

The function `count` can be used to find out how many observations
there are at each level or combination of levels.

How many penguins of each species were observed?

```{r count_species, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r count_species-hint}
count(penguins, ___ )
```

```{r count_species-solution}
count(penguins, species)
```

How many penguins were observed on each of the islands?

```{r island-counts, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r island-counts-solution}
count(penguins, island)
```

How many penguins of each species were observed on each of the islands?

```{r island-species-counts, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r island-species-counts-solution}
count(penguins, species, island)
```

## Flippers and Bills

Use **ggplot** to create a scatter plot of bill length against flipper
length:

```{r simple-scatter, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(___, aes(x = ___, y = ___)) + geom____()
```

```{r simple-scatter-hint-1}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = ___, y = ___)) + geom_point()
```

```{r simple-scatter-hint-2}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = ___)) + geom_point()
```


```{r simple-scatter-solution}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) + geom_point()
```

You can show categorical variables `sex`, `species`, or `island` by
mapping them to the `color` or `shape` aesthetics:

```{r scatter-more, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 6}
ggplot(penguins,
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = bill_length_mm,
           color = ___)) +
    geom_point()
```

It is sometimes useful to use two aesthetic channels as a _redundant
encoding_ of a variable.

Use both color and shape to encode the species variable:

```{r scatter-species, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(penguins,
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = bill_length_mm,
           color = ___,
           shape = ___)) +
    geom_point()
```

```{r scatter-species-solution}
ggplot(penguins,
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = bill_length_mm,
           color = species,
           shape = species)) +
    geom_point()
```

## Spiffing It Up

Let's look at some ways to improve our plot.


### Point Size and Transparency

It can help to make points a little larger. You can do this with the
`size` argument to `geom_point`. Try a size around 2 or 3.

Increasing the point size can lead to more overlap, so making the
points translucent may be useful also. Use the `alpha` argument for this.

* `alpha = 1` is fully opaque;
* `alpha = 0` is transparent.

```{r scatter-size-alpha, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(penguins,
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = bill_length_mm,
           color = species,
           shape = species)) +
    geom_point(___, ___)
```

```{r scatter-size-alpha-solution}
ggplot(penguins,
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = bill_length_mm,
           color = species,
           shape = species)) +
    geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.8)
```


### Changing Colors

The default color palette often works well but you can try other options:

* A [ColorBrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/) palette:
  `scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")`

* A Viridis palette:
  `viridis::scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE)`

* Colors that match the graphic at the beginning:
  `scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4"))`

You can use many different [named
colors](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/) with
`scale_color_manual`.

Try some:

```{r scatter-color, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(penguins,
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = bill_length_mm,
           color = species,
           shape = species)) +
    geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.8) +
    scale_color____(___)
```

```{r scatter-color-solution}
ggplot(penguins,
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = bill_length_mm,
           color = species,
           shape = species)) +
    geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.8) +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4"))
```

### Titles and Labels

Default labels for axes and legends are based on variable names.

This usually fine for exploratory graphs, but can be improved for a
graph to put in a report.

The `labs` function is one way to specify new axis and legend labels:

```{r scatter-labels, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(penguins,
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = bill_length_mm,
           color = species,
           shape = species)) +
    geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.8) +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
    labs(title = ___,
         subtitle = ___,
         color = ___,
         shape = ___,
         x = ___,
         y = ___)
```
```{r mylabs}
mylabs <-
    labs(title = "Flipper and Bill Length",
         subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins at Palmer Station LTER",
         color = "Penguin Species",
         shape = "Penguin Species",
         x = "Flipper Length (mm)",
         y = "Bill Length (mm)")
```
```{r scatter-labels-solution}
<<mylabs>>
ggplot(penguins,
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = bill_length_mm,
           color = species,
           shape = species)) +
    geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.8) +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
    mylabs
```


### Changing Themes

Themes and theme settings control the general appearance of a plot.

Some complete themes to try:

* `theme_minimal()` with less clutter than the default theme.

* `ggthemes::theme_wsj()` a theme based on the Wall Street Journal.

* `ggthemes::theme_economist()` a theme based on the Economist.

Give it a try:

```{r scatter-theme, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(penguins,
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = bill_length_mm,
           color = species,
           shape = species)) +
    geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.8) +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
    mylabs +
    theme_minimal()
```

The `theme` function lets you adjust many individual features.

Here are a few; you can try some more:


```{r scatter-more-theme, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(penguins,
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = bill_length_mm,
           color = species,
           shape = species)) +
    geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.8) +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
    mylabs +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(legend.position = c(0.85, 0.15),
          plot.title.position = "plot")
```
