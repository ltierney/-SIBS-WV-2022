### Luke Tierney
### University of Iowa
### 21 June, 2021

---





## Introduction

In this class I will

* Briefly outline the history of R.

--

* Using some examples briefly show how to do data wrangling
  and visualize data in R.
 
--

Materials for this class are available on GitHub at
&lt;https://github.com/ltierney/SIBS-WV-2021.git&gt;.

--

* You can access it as an RStudio project by following the menu selection
  **File &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git** and specifying this url.

--

* You can use the `git` command line client with
    ```shell
git clone https://github.com/ltierney/SIBS-WV-2021.git
    ```

--

Materials for our _Data Visualization and Data
Technologies_ course are available at

&lt;http://www.stat.uiowa.edu/~luke/classes/STAT4580-2021/&gt;


---

## Introduction: Tools

Some tools I will be using:

--

* The [RStudio](https://www.rstudion.com) IDE.

--

* Many features from the basic [R](https://www.r-project.org) distribution.

--

* Some tools from the [_tidyverse_](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

--

* The [`ggplot`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package based on
  the _Grammar of Graphics_ framework.

--

Most of the packages are loaded by loading the `tidyverse` package


```r
library(tidyverse)
```

**Ask questions any time!**

---
## The R Language

R is a language for data analysis and graphics.

--

* R was originally developed by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka in the
  early 1990's for a Macintosh computer lab at U. of Auckland, New Zealand.

--

* R is based on the S language developed by John Chambers and
  others at Bell Labs.

--

R is an Open Source project.

--

* Since 1997 R is developed and maintained by the R-core group,
  with around 20 members located in maor than 10 different countries.

--

* R is widely used in the field of statistics and beyond, especially in
  university environments.

--

* R has become the primary framework for developing and making available
  new statistical methodology.

--

* Many (now over 17,000) extension packages are available through CRAN or
  similar repositories.

---
## Working with R

R is designed for interactive data exploration.

--

* Interaction is through a _read-eval-print loop (REPL)_.

--

* This is also called a _command line interface (CLI)_.

--

All computations are specified in the R language.

--

* Even for simple tasks you need to know a little of the language.

--

* After learning to do simple tasks you know some of the language.

--

The language is used to
    
--

* prepare data for analysis;

--

* specify individual analyses;

--

* program repeated or similar analyses;

--

* program new methods of analysis.

--

Specifying these tasks in a language supports _reproducible research_.

---
## Working with R

The R language operates on vectors and arrays.

--

Commonly used data types are:

--

* integer and numeric vectors;

--

* logical vectors;

--

* character vectors;

--

* factors.

--

All basic vector types support missing (`NA`) values.

--

Arithmetic operations are vectorized to operate element-wise on vectors.

--

Data vectors are usually combined into table-like objects called _data
frames_.


---
### The Data Analysis Process

A figure that shows the steps usually involved in a data analysis
project:


&lt;center&gt;
<div id="htmlwidget-8d32cfd9db97395c4a5f" style="width:432px;height:288px;" class="nomnoml html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-8d32cfd9db97395c4a5f">{"x":{"code":"\n#fill: #FEFEFF\n#lineWidth: 1\n#zoom: 4\n#direction: right\n\n#padding: 25\n#fontsize: 18\n#fill: #E1DAFF; #D4A9FF\n#stroke: #8515C7\n#linewidth: 2\n\n[Import] -> [Understand]\n[Understand |\n  [Wrangle] -> [Visualize]\n  [Visualize] -> [Model]\n  [Model] -> [Wrangle]\n]\n[Understand] -> [Communicate]","svg":false},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
&lt;/center&gt;

--

These steps are often repeated many times, so it is important to make
your work reproducible.

---
## Reproducible Data Analysis

Making your work reproducible:

--

* Save you work in a text file or notebook.

--

* Track changes to your files with a version control system like
  [`git`](https://git-scm.com/).

--

* Use a system like [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) to
  prepare your reports.

--

This allows you to re-create your report when data changes (as it
often will!).

--

A good resource for setting up your tools to support this is [_Happy
Git and GitHub for the useR_](https://happygitwithr.com/).

# Some Examples

---
## Some Examples

When working with research data, a first step is usually to read and
clean the data.

--

We'll put that off for a little while and work with some data sets
made available in R packages.

--

Data sets available in R packages include:

--

* many classic data sets;

--

* newer, often larger, data sets useful for learning;

--

* current data obtained by querying web APIs.


---
## Old Faithful Eruptions

A simple classic data set is the `geyser` data frame available in
package `MASS`.

--

.pull-left[

```r
data(geyser, package = "MASS")
dim(geyser)
## [1] 299   2
head(geyser, 4)
##   waiting duration
## 1      80 4.016667
## 2      71 2.150000
## 3      57 4.000000
## 4      80 4.000000
```
]
--
.pull-right[
`head` and `tail` return the first and last few rows of a data frame.

They are useful for quick sanity checks.
]

--

The rows represent measurements recorded for eruptions of the _Old
Faithful_ geyser in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming.

--

The variables are:

* `waiting`: the time in minutes since the previous eruption;

--

* `duration`: the duration of the eruption.


---
## Old Faithful Eruptions

The durations have a bimodal distribution:

.pull-left[
![](slides_files/figure-html/geyser-hist-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]
--
.pull-right-foo[

```r
ggplot(geyser) +
    geom_histogram(aes(x = duration),
                   bins = 15,
                   color = "black",
                   fill = "grey")
```
]
--
.pull-right-foo[
A basic template for creating a plot with `ggplot`:

```r
ggplot(data = &lt;DATA&gt;) +
    &lt;GEOM&gt;(mapping = aes(&lt;MAPPINGS&gt;))
```
]

---
## Old Faithful Eruptions

An interesting question is whether the duration can be used to predict
when the _next_ eruption will occur.

--

A plot of the _previous_ duration against the waiting time to the
current eruption:

--

.pull-left[
![](slides_files/figure-html/geyser-scatter-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]
--
.pull-right-foo[

```r
ggplot(geyser) +
    geom_point(aes(x = lag(duration),
                   y = waiting))
```
]
--
.pull-right-foo[
It looks like a useful rule would be to expect a shorter waiting time
after a shorter eruption duration.
]

---
## Old Faithful Eruptions

An interesting feature:

--

Many durations are recorded as 2 or 4 minutes.

--

This can also be seen in a histogram with a small bin width:

.pull-left[
![](slides_files/figure-html/geyser-hist-narrow-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]
--
.pull-right-foo[

```r
p &lt;- ggplot(geyser) +
    geom_histogram(aes(x = duration,
                       y = stat(density)),
                   fill = "grey",
                   color = "black",
*                  binwidth = 0.1)
p
```
]
--
.pull-right-foo[
`ggplot` produces a plot object.
]
--
.pull-right-foo[
Drawing only happens when the object
is printed.
]


---
## Old Faithful Eruptions

Does this rounding matter?

--

* For many analyses it probably doesn't.

--

* It might if you wanted to fit normal distributions to the two groups.

--

.pull-left[
Taking 3 minutes as the divide between short and long durations we can
first pick out the short and long durations:


```r
d &lt;- geyser$duration
d_short &lt;- d[d &lt; 3]
d_long &lt;- d[d &gt;= 3]
```
]
--
.pull-right[
Then compute the means and standard deviations as


```r
mean(d_short)
## [1] 1.980317
sd(d_short)
## [1] 0.2779829
mean(d_long)
## [1] 4.262113
sd(d_long)
## [1] 0.3937525
mean(d &gt;= 3)
## [1] 0.6488294
```
]

---
## Old Faithful Eruptions

An approach that scales better:

--

Compute group summaries using tools from the `dplyr` tidyverse
package.

--

First, add a `type` variable:


```r
geyser &lt;- mutate(geyser, type = ifelse(duration &lt; 3, "short", "long"))
```

--

The summaries can then be computed as


```r
sgd &lt;- summarize(group_by(geyser, type),
                 mean = mean(duration),
                 sd = sd(duration),
                 n = n())
(sgd &lt;- mutate(sgd, prop = n / sum(n)))
## # A tibble: 2 x 5
##   type   mean    sd     n  prop
##   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 long   4.26 0.394   194 0.649
## 2 short  1.98 0.278   105 0.351
```

---
## Old Faithful Eruptions

An alternative approach uses the _pipe operator_:

--


```r
sgd &lt;-
    group_by(geyser, type) %&gt;%
    summarize(mean = mean(duration),
              sd = sd(duration),
              n = n()) %&gt;%
    ungroup() %&gt;%
    mutate(prop = n / sum(n))
sgd
## # A tibble: 2 x 5
##   type   mean    sd     n  prop
##   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 long   4.26 0.394   194 0.649
## 2 short  1.98 0.278   105 0.351
```
--

The pipe operator allows a sequence of operations to be chained together.

--

The left-hand operation is passed implicitly as the first argument to
the function called on the right.


---
## Old Faithful Eruptions

One way to show the superimposed normal densities:

.pull-left[
![](slides_files/figure-html/geyser-hist-dens-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]
--
.pull-right-foo[

```r
f1 &lt;- function(x)
    sgd$prop[1] * dnorm(x, sgd$mean[1], sgd$sd[1])
f2 &lt;- function(x)
    sgd$prop[2] * dnorm(x, sgd$mean[2], sgd$sd[2])
p &lt;- p +
    stat_function(color = "red", fun = f1) +
    stat_function(color = "blue", fun = f2)
p
```
]
--
.pull-right-foo[
A `ggplot` can consist of several _layers_.
]


---
## Old Faithful Eruptions

The means and standard deviations are affected by the rounding.

--

Summaries that omit values equal to 2 or 4 minutes can be computed as


```r
geyser2 &lt;- filter(geyser, duration != 2, duration != 4)
sgd2 &lt;-
    group_by(geyser2, type) %&gt;%
    summarize(mean = mean(duration),
              sd = sd(duration),
              n = n()) %&gt;%
    ungroup() %&gt;%
    mutate(prop = n / sum(n))
sgd2
## # A tibble: 2 x 5
##   type   mean    sd     n  prop
##   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 long   4.36 0.422   141 0.632
## 2 short  1.97 0.315    82 0.368
```

--

`summarize`, `group_by`, and `mutate` are from the `dplyr` package
that implements a _grammar of data manipulation_.


---
## Old Faithful Eruptions

A plot showing curves computed both ways:

--
.pull-left[
![](slides_files/figure-html/geyser-hist-dens-2-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]
--
.pull-right-foo[

```r
f1_2 &lt;- function(x)
    sgd2$prop[1] * dnorm(x, sgd2$mean[1], sgd2$sd[1])
f2_2 &lt;- function(x)
    sgd2$prop[2] * dnorm(x, sgd2$mean[2], sgd2$sd[2])
p &lt;- p +
    stat_function(color = "red",
                  linetype = 2,
                  fun = f1_2) +
    stat_function(color = "blue",
                  linetype = 2,
                  fun = f2_2)
p
```

## Minnesota Barley Yields

A classic data set:

--

Total yield in bushels per acre for 10 varieties at 6 sites in
Minnesota in each of two years, 1931 and 1932.

--

The raw data:


```r
data(barley, package = "lattice")
head(barley)
##      yield   variety year            site
## 1 27.00000 Manchuria 1931 University Farm
## 2 48.86667 Manchuria 1931          Waseca
## 3 27.43334 Manchuria 1931          Morris
## 4 39.93333 Manchuria 1931       Crookston
## 5 32.96667 Manchuria 1931    Grand Rapids
## 6 28.96667 Manchuria 1931          Duluth
```

---
## Minnesota Barley Yields

Some initial plots:


```r
p1 &lt;- ggplot(barley) + geom_point(aes(x = yield, y = variety))
p2 &lt;- ggplot(barley) + geom_point(aes(x = yield, y = site))
cowplot::plot_grid(p1, p2)
```

![](slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
## Minnesota Barley Yields

Using color to separate yields in the two years:


```r
p1 &lt;- ggplot(barley) + geom_point(aes(x = yield, y = variety, color = year))
p2 &lt;- ggplot(barley) + geom_point(aes(x = yield, y = site, color = year))
cowplot::plot_grid(p1, p2)
```

![](slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
## Minnesota Barley Yields

Can we also show `site` using symbol shape?

--

.pull-left[
![](slides_files/figure-html/barley-color-sym-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]
--
.pull-right-foo[

```r
ggplot(barley) +
    geom_point(aes(x = yield,
                   y = variety,
                   color = year,
*                  shape = site))
```
]
--
.pull-right-foo[
There is a lot of _interference_ between shape and color.
]


---
## Minnesota Barley Yields

                   color = year,
                   shape = site),
*              size = 2.5)
```

Possible improvements:

* larger points

```

Possible improvements:

* larger points
* jittering
]


---
## Minnesota Barley Yields

Another approach: _faceting_ to produce _small multiples_.


```r
ggplot(barley) +
    geom_point(aes(x = yield, y = variety, color = year)) +
    facet_wrap(~site)
```

![](slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
## Minnesota Barley Yields

Focusing on summaries can help. 

--
A _dot plot_:

.pull-left[
![](slides_files/figure-html/barley-avg-dot-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]
--
.pull-right[

```r
barley_site_year &lt;-
    group_by(barley, site, year) %&gt;%
    summarize(yield = mean(yield)) %&gt;%
    ungroup()

ggplot(barley_site_year) +
    geom_point(aes(y = site,
                   x = yield,
                   color = year),
               size = 3)
```
]

---
## Minnesota Barley Yields

Adding lines can help comparing the changes. This is sometimes called
a _dumbbell chart_:

.pull-left[
![](slides_files/figure-html/barley-avg-dot-2-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]
.pull-right[

```r
barley_site_year &lt;-
    group_by(barley, site, year) %&gt;%
    summarize(yield = mean(yield)) %&gt;%
    ungroup()

ggplot(barley_site_year) +
*   geom_line(aes(y = site,
*                 x = yield,
*                 group = site),
*             color = "darkgrey",
*             size = 2) +
    geom_point(aes(y = site,
                   x = yield,
                   color = year),
*              size = 4)
```
]

---
## Minnesota Barley Yields

_Bar charts_ are sometimes used for summaries, but dot plots are
usually a better choice.
.pull-left[
![](slides_files/figure-html/barley-avg-bar-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]
.pull-right[

```r
ggplot(barley_site_year) +
    geom_col(aes(x = yield,
                 y = site,
                 fill = year),
             size = 3,
             position = "dodge",
             width = .4)
```
]

---
## Bar Charts and the Zero Base Line

Because of the way we perceive bars, it is important to use a [zero
base line for bar
charts](https://flowingdata.com/2015/08/31/bar-chart-baselines-start-at-zero/).

## Hair and Eye Color Data

A data set recording the distribution of hair and eye color and sex in
592 statistics students.


.pull-left[

```r

                 y = Freq),
             position = "dodge")
```
]

---
## Hair and Eye Color Data

Mapping eye color to color in addition to the horizontal axis can help:

.pull-left[
![](slides_files/figure-html/eye-bar-2-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]
.pull-right[

```r
eye &lt;-
    group_by(HairEyeDF, Eye) %&gt;%
    summarize(Freq = sum(Freq)) %&gt;%
    ungroup()

ggplot(eye) +
    geom_col(aes(x = Eye,
                 y = Freq,
*                fill = Eye),
             position = "dodge")
```
]

---
## Hair and Eye Color Data

More sensible colors would be nice but require a bit of work:

.pull-left[
![](slides_files/figure-html/eye-bar-3-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]
.pull-right[

```r
hazel_rgb &lt;-
    col2rgb("brown") * 0.75 + col2rgb("green") * 0.25
hazel &lt;-
    do.call(rgb, as.list(hazel_rgb / 255))

cols &lt;-
    c(Blue = colorspace::lighten(colorspace::desaturate("blue", 0.3), 0.3),
      Green = colorspace::lighten("forestgreen", 0.1),
      Brown = colorspace::lighten("brown", 0.0001), ## 0.3?
      Hazel = colorspace::lighten(hazel, 0.3))

pb &lt;- ggplot(eye) +
    geom_col(aes(x = Eye,
                 y = Freq,
                 fill = Eye),
             position = "dodge") +
    scale_fill_manual(values = cols)
pb
```
]

---
## Hair and Eye Color Data

A _stacked bar chart_ can also be useful:

.pull-left[
![](slides_files/figure-html/eye-bar-stacked-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]
.pull-right[

```r
psb &lt;- ggplot(eye) +
    geom_col(aes(x = "", y = Freq, fill = Eye), color = "lightgrey") +
    scale_fill_manual(values = cols)
psb
```
]

---
## Hair and Eye Color Data

Changing to polar coordinates produces a _pie chart_:

.pull-left[
![](slides_files/figure-html/eye-pie-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]
.pull-right[

```r
(pp &lt;- psb + coord_polar("y"))
```
]

---
## Hair and Eye Color Data

The axis and grid are not helpful; a _theme_ adjustment can remove them:

.pull-left[
![](slides_files/figure-html/eye-pie-2-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]
.pull-right-foo[

```r
(pp &lt;- pp + theme_void())
```
]
--
.pull-right-foo[
Themes provide a way to customize the non-data components of plots:
i.e. titles, labels, fonts, background, grid lines, and legends.
]
--
.pull-right-foo[
Themes can be used to give plots a consistent customized look.
]
--
.pull-right-foo[
The `ggthemes` package provides a number of themes to emulate the
style of different publications, for example `theme_wsj` and
`theme_economist`.

## Hair and Eye Color Data

How well do bar charts and pie charts work?

--

.pull-left[
![](slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]
--
.pull-right[
Some questions:

* Which plot makes it easier to tell whether the proportion of
  brown-eyed students is larger or smaller that the proportion of
  blue-eyed students?

* Which plot makes it easier to tell whether these proportions are
  larger or smaller than 1/2 or 1/4 or 1/3?
]

---
## Hair and Eye Color Data

Looking at the proportions within hair color and sex:

.hide-code[

```r
eye_hairsex &lt;-
    group_by(HairEyeDF, Hair, Sex) %&gt;%
    mutate(Prop = Freq / sum(Freq)) %&gt;%
    ungroup()

p1 &lt;- ggplot(eye_hairsex) +
    geom_col(aes(x = Eye, y = Prop, fill = Eye)) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = cols) +
    facet_grid(Hair~Sex)
p2 &lt;- ggplot(eye_hairsex) +
    geom_col(aes(x = "", y = Prop, fill = Eye)) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = cols) +
    coord_polar("y")+facet_grid(Hair~Sex) +

## A Simple Model of Visual Perception

The eyes acquire an image, which is processed through three stages of
memory:

--

* Iconic memory

--

* Working memory, or short-term memory

--

* Long-term memory

--

The first processing stage of an image happens in iconic memory.

--

* Images remain in iconic memory for less than a second.

--

* Processing in iconic memory is massively parallel and automatic.

--

* This is called _preattentive processing_.

--

Preattentive processing is a fast recognition process.

---
## A Simple Model of Visual Perception

Meaningful visual chunks are moved from iconic memory to short term memory.

--

* These chunks are used by conscious, or attentive, processing.

--

* Attentive processing often involves conscious comparisons or search.

--

* Short term memory is limited;

    * information is retained for only a few seconds;
    * only three or fours chunks can be held at a time.

--

Long term visual memory is built up over a lifetime, though
infrequently used visual chunks may become lost.

---
## Visual Design Implications

Try to make as much use of preattentive features as possible.

--

Recognize when preattentive features might mislead.

--

For features that require attentive processing, keep in mind that
working memory is limited.


---
## Some Terms for Describing Visualizations

Data to be visualized contains _variables_ or _attributes_ measured on
individual _items_ or _cases_.

--

_Links_ are relationships that may exist among items, e.g. months
within a year or countries within a continent.

--

_Marks_ are individual geometric entities used to represent items:
points. bars, etc.

--

_Aesthetics_ or _visual channels_ are the visual features of marks
that can be used to encode attributes.

--

The `aes(...)` expressions establish the mapping between attributes
and visual channels.

--

These ideas closely mirror the structure of the _grammar of graphics_
as implemented in `ggplot`.

&gt;  Design_](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/vadbook/), CRC Press.

## Channels and their Accuracy

A useful distinction among channels:

--

* _Magnitude channels_ can reflect order and numeric values,
  e.g. position on an axis, length, area, brightness.

--

* _Identity channels_ can distinguish different values but not reflect
  order, e.g. hue, shape, grouping.

--

Some channels are better at conveying information than others.

---
## Channels and their Accuracy

Munzner's ordering by accuracy:

--

| Magnitude Channels (Ordered, Numerical) | Identity Channels (Categorical) |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Position on common scale                | Spatial grouping                |
| Position on unaligned scale             | Color hue                       |
| Length (1D size)                        | Shape                           |
| Tilt, angle                             |                                 |
| Area (2D size)                          |                                 |
| Depth (3D position)                     |                                 |
| Color luminance, saturation             |                                 |
| Curvature, volume (3D size)             |                                 |
--

Line width is another channel; not sure there is agreement on its
accuracy, but it is not high.

---
## Visual Design Implications

Try to map the most important variables to the strongest channels.


---
## Color

Color is very effective when used well.

--

But using color well is not easy.

--

Some of the issues:

--

* Perception depends on context.

--

* Simple color assignments may not separate equally well.

--

* Effectiveness may vary with the medium (screen, projector, print).

--

* Some people do not perceive the full specturm of colors.

--

* Grey scale printing.

--

* Some colors have cultural significance.

--

* Cultural significance may vary among cultures and with time.

---
## Color

Color perception is relative:

# A Grammar of Data Manipulation

---
## A Grammar of Data Manipulation

The `dplyr` package provides a language, or grammar, for data
manipulation.

--

The design of `dplyr` is strongly motivated by SQL.

--

The language contains a number of _verbs_ that operate on tables.

--

The most commonly used verbs operate on a single data frame:

--

* `select`: pick variables by their names

--

* `filter`: choose rows that satisfy some criteria

--

* `mutate`: create transformed or derived variables

--

* `arrange`: reorder the rows

--

* `summarize`: collapse rows down to summaries

--

There are also a number of `join` verbs that merge several data frames
into one.

--

Package `tidyr` provides more verbs, such as `pivot_longer` and
`pivot_wider` for reshaping data frames.

--

The single table verbs can also be used with `group_by` to work
separately on groups of rows.

## More Examples

These examples start with raw data as you might receive it from a
researcher, and involve reading and cleaning the data.

--

Common data formats you might encounter include

--

* [_CSV_ (comma-separated
  values)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) files.

--

* Text files using other delimiters, such as tabs or `|` characters.

--

* [JSON(JavaScript Object
  Notation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) files.
  
--

* [XML (Extensible Markup
  Language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) files.

--

* Excel spreadsheets.

--

Tools are available for reading data in these formats into R.

## Wind Turbines in Iowa

There are many wind turbines in Iowa.

--

Data is available from the [U.S. Wind Turbine
Database](https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uswtdb/).

--

A snapshot is available is [here](../data/us_wind.csv) as a CSV file.

--

* CSV files are a common form of data exchange.

--

* They are simple text files that are intended to be written and read
  by a computer.

--

* Some CSV files include a header and a footer that need to he handled.

--

* One issue is that a comma isn't a good separator in countries where
  it is the decimal separator!

--

* A CSV file can be read using `read.csv` or `readr::read_csv`.

--

Reading the wind turbine data:


```r
wind_turbines &lt;- read.csv("../data/us_wind.csv", comment = "#")
```

---
## Wind Turbines in Iowa

Some data cleaning is needed.

--

Focus on the wind turbines in IOWA (19 is the [FIPS county
code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_county_code) for Iowa):


```r
wt_IA &lt;- filter(wind_turbines, t_fips %/% 1000 == 19)
```
--

Drop entries with missing longitude or latitude values:


```r
wt_IA &lt;- filter(wt_IA, ! is.na(xlong), ! is.na(ylat))
```
--

Some missing year values are encoded as -9999; replace these with `NA`:


```r
wt_IA &lt;- mutate(wt_IA, p_year = replace(p_year, p_year &lt; 0, NA))
```

---

## Cancer Map

The website &lt;http://www.cancer-rates.info/ia&gt; provides data on
cancer incidence for a number of different cancers in Iowa.

--

The data for lung and bronchus cancer in 2011 are available in a [csv
file](../data/Invasive-Cancer-Incidence-Rates-by-County-in-Iowa-Lung-and-Bronchus-2011.csv)
in the project.

--

We can read the file with `read_csv` from the `readr` package.

--

Looking at the file shows some things that need to be cleaned up:

--

* Two header lines at the beginning.

--

* Some footer lines.

--

* Some values codes as `~`.


---
## Cancer Map

The header can be handled by using `skip = 2` in the `read_csv` call:


```r

d &lt;- read_csv(fname, skip = 2)

---
## Cancer Map

Let's focus on a few variables and give them more convenient names:


```r
d &lt;- select(d, county = 1, population = 2, count = 3)
```

--

The footer needs to be removed:


```r
tail(d)
## # A tibble: 6 x 3
##   county                                                        population count
##   &lt;chr&gt;                                                              &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;
## 1 Butler                                                             14960 5    
## 2 Winneshiek                                                         21045 ~    
## 3 STATE                                                            3065223 2368

## 6 Based on data released Nov 2017.                                      NA &lt;NA&gt;
```

--

One way to remove the footer:


```r
d &lt;- filter(d, ! is.na(population))
d &lt;- filter(d, county != "STATE")
```

---
## Cancer Map

Changing `count` to numeric changes the `~` entries to missing values
(`NA`) values:


```r
d &lt;- mutate(d, count = as.numeric(count))
## Warning in mask$eval_all_mutate(quo): NAs introduced by coercion
```

--

In this case there are no zero case values; two ways to check:


```r
count(d, count == 0)
## # A tibble: 2 x 2
##   `count == 0`     n
##   &lt;lgl&gt;        &lt;int&gt;
## 1 FALSE           95
## 2 NA               4
any(d$count == 0, na.rm = TRUE)
## [1] FALSE
```

--

It _might_ be reasonable to assume these values where zero, so replace
them with zeros:


```r
d &lt;- replace_na(d, list(count = 0))
```

---
## Cancer Map

A _choropleth map_ uses color or shading to represent values measured
for different geographic regions.

--

We will need to merge, or _left join_, the cancer data with the map
date we loaded for the wind turbine map.

--

This requires a _key_ on which to match the records in the cancer data
and the map data.

--

For Iowa this can be done with the county name, but some care is needed:


```r
d$county[1]
## [1] "Union"
iowa_sf$ID[1]
## [1] "iowa,adair"
```

--

Fixing case differences and dropping the `iowa,` prefix:



```r
d &lt;- mutate(d, cname = county, county = tolower(county))
iowa_sf &lt;- mutate(iowa_sf, ID = sub("iowa,", "", ID))
iowa_sf &lt;- rename(iowa_sf, county = ID)
```

---
## Cancer Map

Still not quite there:


```r
setdiff(d$county, iowa_sf$county)
## [1] "o'brien"
setdiff(iowa_sf$county, d$county)
## [1] "obrien"
```

Drop the apostrophe in O'Brien:


```r

## Unemployment Map

[Local Area Unemployment Statistics page](https://www.bls.gov/lau/)
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics makes available county-level
monthly unemployment data for a 14-month window.

--

The file for February 2020 through March 2021 is available is
available at
&lt;http://www.stat.uiowa.edu/~luke/data/laus/laucntycur14-2020.txt&gt; and
in the project data folder.

--

This file is a text file but uses a non-standard separator.

--

It is designed for human readability and uses
a comma as a _thousands separator_ or _grouping mark_.

--

It also includes header and footer information.

--

It is still reasonably easy to read in.

---
## Unemployment Map

One way to read the data into R is:


```r
lausURL &lt;- "../data/laucntycur14-2020.txt"
lausUS &lt;- read.table(lausURL,
                     col.names = c("LAUSAreaCode", "State", "County",
                                   "Title", "Period",
                                   "LaborForce", "Employed",
                                   "Unemployed", "UnempRate"),
                     quote = '"', sep = "|", skip = 6,
                     stringsAsFactors = FALSE, strip.white = TRUE,
                     fill = TRUE)
footstart &lt;- grep("------", lausUS$LAUSAreaCode)
lausUS &lt;- lausUS[1:(footstart - 1),]
```

---
## Unemployment Map

It may be useful to be able to access the county name and state name
separately:


```r
lausUS &lt;- separate(lausUS, Title, c("cname", "scode"),
                   sep = ", ", fill = "right")
```

--

Check the variable types:


```r
sapply(lausUS, class)
## LAUSAreaCode        State       County        cname        scode       Period 
##  "character"    "integer"    "integer"  "character"  "character"  "character" 
##   LaborForce     Employed   Unemployed    UnempRate 
##  "character"  "character"  "character"  "character"
```

--

The `UnempRate` variable is read as character data because of missing
value encoding, so needs to be converted to numeric:


```r
lausUS &lt;- mutate(lausUS, UnempRate = as.numeric(UnempRate))
## Warning in mask$eval_all_mutate(quo): NAs introduced by coercion
```

---
## Unemployment Map

Check for missing values:


```r
select_if(lausUS, anyNA) %&gt;% names()
## [1] "scode"     "UnempRate"
```

--

The state code is missing for the District of Columbia:


```r
select(lausUS, cname, scode) %&gt;%
    filter(is.na(scode)) %&gt;%
    unique()
##                  cname scode
## 1 District of Columbia  &lt;NA&gt;
```
--

&lt;!--
Missing values for `UnempRate` are all for Puerto Rico and September
2017. Hurricane Maria made landfall on September 20. --&gt;

March and April 2020 numbers were not available for Puerto Rico:


```r
select(lausUS, scode, Period, UnempRate) %&gt;%
    filter(is.na(UnempRate)) %&gt;%
    unique()
##    scode Period UnempRate
## 1     PR Mar-20        NA
## 79    PR Apr-20        NA
```

---
## Unemployment Map

To compute the national monthly unemployment rates over this period we
need some more data cleaning:


```r
lausUS &lt;- mutate(lausUS,
                 Period = fct_inorder(Period),
                 LaborForce = as.numeric(gsub(",", "", LaborForce)),
                 Unemployed = as.numeric(gsub(",", "", Unemployed)))
## Warning in mask$eval_all_mutate(quo): NAs introduced by coercion

## Warning in mask$eval_all_mutate(quo): NAs introduced by coercion
```

---
## Unemployment Map

Unemployment during this period was affected significantly by the
COVID-19 pandemic.

A plot shows a large spike in April 2020:

.hide-code[

```r
group_by(lausUS, Period) %&gt;%
    summarize(Unemployed = sum(Unemployed, na.rm = TRUE),
              LaborForce = sum(LaborForce, na.rm = TRUE),
              UnempRate = 100 * (Unemployed / LaborForce)) %&gt;%
    ggplot(aes(Period, UnempRate, group = 1)) +
    geom_line()
```

]

---
## Unemployment Map

A choropleth map can be used to look at how the impact was distributed
across the country.

--

To show unemployment rates on a map we need to merge the unemployment data
with map data.

--

To match county unemployment data and county shape data it is safer to
use the numeric [FIPS county
code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_county_code). This can be
added with


```r
lausUS &lt;- mutate(lausUS, fips = State * 1000 + County)
```
--

Shape data for US counties can be obtained from a number of sources in a
number of different formats.

--

Here is one approach:


```r
counties_sf &lt;- sf::st_as_sf(maps::map("county", plot = FALSE, fill = TRUE))
county.fips &lt;-
    mutate(maps::county.fips, polyname = sub(":.*", "", polyname)) %&gt;%
    unique()
counties_sf &lt;- left_join(counties_sf, county.fips, c("ID" = "polyname"))
states_sf &lt;-  sf::st_as_sf(maps::map("state", plot = FALSE, fill = TRUE))
```

---
## Unemployment Map

Some summaries over the period can be computed as


```r
summaryUS &lt;- group_by(lausUS, County, State, fips) %&gt;%
    summarize(avg_unemp = mean(UnempRate, na.rm = TRUE),
              max_unemp = max(UnempRate, na.rm = TRUE),
              apr_unemp = UnempRate[Period == "Apr-20"]) %&gt;%
    ungroup()
## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'County', 'State'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.
head(summaryUS)
## # A tibble: 6 x 6
##   County State  fips avg_unemp max_unemp apr_unemp
##    &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1      1     1  1001      4.65      10.9      10.9
## 2      1     4  4001     12.7       17.6      16.6
## 3      1     5  5001      4.06       5.2       4.8
## 4      1     6  6001      8.8       14.6      14.6
## 5      1     8  8001      8.3       12.7      12.7
## 6      1     9  9001      8.31      11.7       8.2
```

---
## Unemployment Map

A choropleth map of the April 2020 unemployment rates:

.hide-code[

```r
left_join(counties_sf, summaryUS, "fips") %&gt;%
    ggplot() +
    geom_sf(aes(fill = apr_unemp)) +
    scale_fill_viridis(name = "Rate", na.value = "red") +
    theme_map() +
    geom_sf(data = states_sf, col = "grey", fill = NA)
```

![](slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-53-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

---
## Unemployment Map

Using a very visible color for missing data is useful, at least during
exploration.

--

`anti_join` can show the county geometry that does not have an entry
in the unemployment data:


```r
anti_join(counties_sf, summaryUS, "fips")
## Simple feature collection with 1 feature and 2 fields
## Geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON
## Dimension:     XY
## Bounding box:  xmin: -103.0121 ymin: 42.99475 xmax: -102.0782 ymax: 43.68803
## CRS:           EPSG:4326
##                     ID  fips                           geom
## 1 south dakota,shannon 46113 MULTIPOLYGON (((-102.8115 4...
```

--

Shannon County, SD (FIPS 46113), was renamed to [Oglala Lakota County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oglala_Lakota_County,_South_Dakota) in June 2015 and given a new FIPS code, 46102.

--

The geometry data table needs to be updated:


```r
counties_sf &lt;- mutate(counties_sf, fips = replace(fips, fips == 46113, 46102))
```

---
## Unemployment Map

With the updated data the map is now complete:

.hide-code[

```r
left_join(counties_sf, summaryUS, "fips") %&gt;%
    ggplot() +
    geom_sf(aes(fill = apr_unemp)) +
    scale_fill_viridis(name = "Rate", na.value = "red") +
    theme_map() +
    geom_sf(data = states_sf, col = "grey", fill = NA)
```
